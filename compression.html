	<!-- Images NevadaSmall2 and NevadaSmall3 are appropriate to place on a website because the image is so small, the user will not tell the difference. In addition, the NevadaSmall2 and 3 images are very compact and don't take up much space. However, the larger Nevada3 and Nevada4 images are significantly worse quality than Nevada1 and Nevada2. In this case, it would most likely be best to choose Nevada2 because its the best choice for its quality, and size. -->
